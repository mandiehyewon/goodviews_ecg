%\section{Cohort}
%
%\emph{This section is optional, more theoretical work may not need
%  this section.  However, if you are using health data, then you need
%  to describe it carefully so that the clinicians can validate the
%  soundness of your choices.}
%
%Describe the cohort.  Give us the details of any inclusion/exclusion
%criteria, what data were extracted, how features were processed,
%etc.  Recommended headings include:
%
%\subsection{Cohort Selection}
%with choice of criteria and basic numbers, as well as any relevant
%information about the study design (such how cases and controls were
%identified, if appropriate),
%
%\subsection{Data Extraction}
%with what raw information you extracted or collected, including any
%assumptions and imputation that may have been used, and
%
%\subsection{Feature Choices}
%with how you might have converted the raw data into features that were
%used in your algorithm.
%
%Cohort descriptions are just as important as methods details and code
%to replicate a study.  For more clinical application papers, each of
%the sections above might be several paragraphs because we really want
%to understand the setting.
%
%For the submission, please do \emph{not} include the name of the
%institutions for any private data sources.  However, in the
%camera-ready, you may include identifying information about the
%institution as well as should include any relevant IRB approval
%statements.
%
%\input{Sections/4_Results}
%
%\paragraph{Limitations}
%
%Explain when your approach may not apply, or things you could not
%check.  \emph{Discussing limitations is essential.  Both ACs and
%  reviewers have been coached to be skeptical of any work that does
%  not consider limitations.}

% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ONLY GO IN THE CAMERA-READY, NOT THE SUBMISSION

\appendix
\section*{Appendix A.}

Some more details about those methods, so we can actually reproduce
them.  After the blind review period, you could link to a repository
for the code also.  \emph{MLHC values both rigorous evaluation as well
  as reproduciblity.}
